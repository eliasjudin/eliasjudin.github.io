Thought cannot grasp an object independent of its being-given-to-thought, nor conceive of a subject detached from its relation to an object. Meillassoux’s breaks free of this enclosure with the <em>arche-fossil</em>: scientific statements, like those dating the accretion of the Earth or the formation of stars, which refer to a reality chronologically <em>anterior</em> to the emergence of life and, consequently, anterior to any thought or consciousness. The <em>arche-fossil</em> presents a profound challenge: how can science meaningfully speak of a time when the correlation itself did not exist? How can a discourse meaningful <em>for us</em>, now, denote a reality radically independent of any <em>us</em>? The <em>arche-fossil</em> signifies a reality definitively <em>not for us</em> in its origin, yet seemingly accessed <em>by us</em> through mathematized science.</p><p>Against this backdrop of radical, observer-independent reality, Simone Weil’s reflections resonate. In her writings on the use of studies, intellectual labor, especially the rigors of mathematics, becomes a spiritual exercise. It is the cultivation of <em>attention</em> – a patient, humble, receptive waiting upon truth – that matters most. For Weil, knowledge is not mere data acquisition; it is a transformative process intrinsically valuable <em>for us</em>, leading towards love and a form of prayerful connection to a reality beyond the self. The goal is less the object known, and more the quality of the knowing subject&rsquo;s engagement.</p><p>AI systems, confined to the ontologies and knowledge graphs defined by human creators, initially appear as powerful extensions of the <em>for us</em>. They operate within the &ldquo;house&rdquo; we built, trained on our data, designed to answer our questions, potentially generating solutions to problems or proofs of propositions within our established mathematical frameworks. This AI accelerates exploration within the bounds of human-correlated mathematics. Its explanations are <em>for us</em>, limited by the very structures we provide <em>for it</em>.</p><p>The crucial speculative question arises when considering AI&rsquo;s potential to exceed these bounds. Suppose an AI generates a mathematical structure, a proof, entirely alien to our methods, built using tools or logic it has derived autonomously – a structure not built <em>for us</em>, perhaps initially generated <em>for it</em>, for its own operational logic. If this structure remains fundamentally opaque to human understanding, despite its demonstrable validity within the AI&rsquo;s framework, what have we encountered? Is it still knowledge? Or is it merely information, an artifact pointing towards that ancestral mathematical reality Meillassoux gestures towards? This scenario mirrors the <em>arche-fossil</em>: we have evidence of something real, something structured, yet it resists integration into the meaningful world constituted by human attention. It exists, but perhaps not <em>for us</em>.</p><p>The existence of an ancestral mathematics, like the existence of the pre-biotic Earth, does not depend on our capacity to comprehend it. AI might become a probe capable of detecting signals from this realm, computational artifacts whose internal consistency points to truths unmoored from human intuition or axiomatics. Such discoveries would challenge the anthropocentric bias inherent in viewing mathematics solely as a human construction or a language <em>for us</em>.</p><p>Yet, Weil&rsquo;s reflections provide a counterpoint regarding meaning and value. Even if AI unveils fragments of an ancestral mathematical truth, their significance <em>for us</em> remains contingent on our ability to bring our attention to bear upon them. The value <em>for us</em> lies not in the mere existence of the truth, but in the human act of engaging with it, struggling towards its assimilation, allowing it to shape the attentive mind. An incomprehensible proof, however valid in its own terms, remains outside this transformative circuit. It is like an <em>arche-fossil</em> locked away in a vault – its existence is noted, but it does not participate in the living practice of understanding. The challenge then becomes not just accessing these potential AI-generated structures, but finding ways to translate them, to build bridges, to render them amenable to human attention, lest they remain mere curiosities from a realm definitively not <em>for us</em>.</p></div></article></div></main><div class=vl-footer-note>© 2024 by Elias Judin</div></div></div></body></html>
