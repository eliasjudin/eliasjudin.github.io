We define various algebraic structures via $\Omega$-algebras (from universal algebra) with an emphasis on semimodules. We continue to define, categorically, the property of an algebraic structure being &lt;em>free&lt;/em>, and show that this is a &lt;em>universal property&lt;/em>. We construct the free semimodule on a set and explore various examples of them appearing in mathematics. We observe that the free semimodule on a set is a universal arrow from that set to the forgetful functor and that there is a functor called the &lt;em>free functor&lt;/em> that is the left adjoint to the forgetful functor and which provides an equivalent characterisation of the property of being free. That is, when the object is in the image of the free functor.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Free algebras by means of a universal property</title><link>https://eliasjudin.github.io/blog/free_algebras_by_means_of_a_universal_property/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Jun 2022 12:22:12 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://eliasjudin.github.io/blog/free_algebras_by_means_of_a_universal_property/</guid><description>&lt;p>Consider a vector space $V$, when $X$ is a basis of $V$, we say that $V$ is a &lt;em>free vector space on&lt;/em> $X$ &lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>.

We can define various algebraic structures as algebraic categories. For example, in order to define $\textbf{Groups}$, the category of Groups, we can specify $\Omega = \{e,m,i\}$ as the set consisting of three operators: one nullary, one unary, and one binary, such that, $(G,e,m)$ is a monoid and $$m(i(x),x)=x=m(x,(i(x))$$ $\forall x \in G$, making $\textbf{Alg}(\Omega) = \textbf{Groups}$ for $\Omega$ as specified&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>. However, an issue arises when considering vector spaces over a field and modules over a ring as the operators in $\Omega$ are defined to act on the elements of the underlying set, and not on elements outside of that set, say in a field or a ring. This issue arises when trying to define scalar multiplication for these structures. Consider a vector space $V$ over a field $K$. We define a binary operator $m$ on $V$ called multiplication, then $v(m):V^2\to V$, where $$v: \Omega \to \bigcup_{n \in \mathbf{N}} V^{V^{n}}$$ for $\mathbf{N}$ the natural numbers&lt;sup id="fnref1:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>. Now there is an issue since $m$ is not defined to operate on the elements of $K$. What follows is an explanation as to how we can get around this issue and define vector spaces over a field $K$ and modules over a ring $R$ as algebraic categories.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
