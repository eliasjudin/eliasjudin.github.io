Thought cannot grasp an object independent of its being-given-to-thought, nor conceive of a subject detached from its relation to an object. Meillassoux’s breaks free of this enclosure with the &lt;em>arche-fossil&lt;/em>: scientific statements, like those dating the accretion of the Earth or the formation of stars, which refer to a reality chronologically &lt;em>anterior&lt;/em> to the emergence of life and, consequently, anterior to any thought or consciousness. The &lt;em>arche-fossil&lt;/em> presents a profound challenge: how can science meaningfully speak of a time when the correlation itself did not exist? How can a discourse meaningful &lt;em>for us&lt;/em>, now, denote a reality radically independent of any &lt;em>us&lt;/em>? The &lt;em>arche-fossil&lt;/em> signifies a reality definitively &lt;em>not for us&lt;/em> in its origin, yet seemingly accessed &lt;em>by us&lt;/em> through mathematized science.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
