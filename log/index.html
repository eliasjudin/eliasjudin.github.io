This is how I understood it. Scholze is basically fixing that <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="sans-serif">T</mi><mi mathvariant="sans-serif">o</mi><mi mathvariant="sans-serif">p</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathsf{Top}</annotation></semantics></math> is bad for algebra by switching to a setting where descent actually works. He complains that quotients in Top are “violent" and destroy algebraic structure (like how topological abelian groups aren&rsquo;t an abelian category) but I think he’s just pointing out that topological quotients aren&rsquo;t effective descent morphisms for &rsquo;nice&rsquo; algebraic structures. Scholze replaces spaces with sheaves on profinite sets (making them projective generators), which seems to be exactly how you force the covers he wants to become effective for descent. Notably, while <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="sans-serif">T</mi><mi mathvariant="sans-serif">o</mi><mi mathvariant="sans-serif">p</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathsf{Top}</annotation></semantics></math> works fine as a topological category (meaning it admits initial liftings of structured sources, which implies completeness/cocompleteness), it fails to be an exact category because those quotients aren&rsquo;t effective (specifically, it is not Barr-exact).</p><h2 id=december-2025>December 2025</h2><p>Solved the Jane Street puzzle for December, <a href=https://www.janestreet.com/puzzles/robot-javelin-index/>Robot Javelin</a>.</p><p>Featured in Simon Willison&rsquo;s write-up on OpenAI skills (December 12, 2025). <a href=https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/12/openai-skills/>Read it</a> · <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46250332">HN</a> · <a href=https://www.techmeme.com/251212/p35#a251212p35>Techmeme</a> · <a href=https://github.com/eliasjudin/oai-skills>Repo</a>

What will be the science which deals with the notions invariant under this widest class of transformations? Here we will have very few notions, all of a very general character. I suggest that they are the logical notions, that we call a notion &ldquo;logical&rdquo; if it is invariant under all possible one-one transformations of the world onto itself (<a href=https://philarchive.org/rec/TARWAL><em>&ldquo;What are logical notions?&rdquo;</em>, Alfred Tarski, 1986</a>, p. 149).</p></blockquote><hr><p>&ldquo;Finitely complete co-pretoposes are ideally exact.&rdquo;

Semi-abelian categories were introduced in <a href=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022404901001037>(JMT)</a> to provide a categorical
context in which to give a general treatment of the properties of the categories
of groups, Lie algebras, and other related algebraic structures. Certain
categories which have been of interest in classical algebra are not
semi-abelian; these include rings with identity, Boolean algebras, and Heyting
algebras (among others). Ideally exact categories were introduced in <a href=http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/volumes/41/11/41-11.pdf>(J)</a> as a
non-pointed counterpart to semi-abelian categories and include the
above-mentioned categories as examples.</p><p>A topos provides a categorical context in which one can &ldquo;do mathematics.&rdquo;
Examples of toposes include the category of sets or, more generally, functor
categories of sets, as well as the category of sheaves on a site. It turns out
that every cotopos is ideally exact (see <a href=https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/81106713.pdf>(B)</a> for exactness and protomodularity).
The category of compact Hausdorff spaces is not a topos but satisfies two
important properties of a topos, namely, it is extensive and exact. It was
shown in <a href=https://www.mat.uc.pt/preprints/ps/p2412.pdf>(BC)</a> that the opposite of the category of pointed objects of the
category of compact Hausdorff spaces is semi-abelian.</p><p>In this talk, we will briefly outline the known proof showing that co-toposes
are ideally exact and give an outline of the proof that finitely complete
co-pretoposes are ideally exact.</p></blockquote><p>(B) D. Bourn, <a href=https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/81106713.pdf>Protomodular aspect of the dual of a topos</a>, Adv. Math. 187 (2004),

<strong><a href=https://math.sun.ac.za/mhoefnagel/>Michael Hoefnagel</a></strong></p><blockquote><p><strong>abstract.</strong>
Extensivity of a category may be described as a property of coproducts in the category, namely, that they are disjoint and universal. An alternative viewpoint is that it is a property of morphisms in a category. This talk explores this point of view through a natural notion of extensive and coextensive morphism. There is an interesting interplay between the algebraic and the categorical. One the one hand, through these notions several topics in algebra related to (unique) factorisation and refinement of direct products, such as the strict refinement or Fraser-Horn properties, take categorical form, and thereby enjoy all the benefits of categorical generalisation. On the other hand, the algebraic theory surrounding these topics inspire categorical results. One such result is that a Barr-exact category is coextensive if and only if every split monomorphism in the category coextensive.</p></blockquote><p><em>Category Theory Seminar Talk, October 30</em></p><hr><p><a href=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00878100><em>Facets of descent I</em></a> by George Janelidze & Walter Tholen.</p><p><a href=/blog/sheaves-and-presheaves>Sheaves are presheaves with an equalizer diagram</a></p><figure><img src=#ZgotmplZ alt="Diagram relating opens of X, presheaves, sheaves, spaces over X, and étale spaces." loading=lazy><img src alt="Diagram relating opens of X, presheaves, sheaves, spaces over X, and étale spaces." loading=lazy><figcaption>Sheaves, presheaves, and étale spaces over X.</figcaption></figure><p>The Yoneda embedding <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mi>Y</mi><mo>:</mo><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">Open</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>X</mi><mo>)</mo></mrow><mo>→</mo><msup><mi mathvariant="normal">Set</mi><mrow><msup><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">Open</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>X</mi><mo>)</mo></mrow><mtext>op</mtext></msup></mrow></msup></mrow>

This has got to be one of the greatest biographies of Einstein, as Roger Penrose wrote, &ldquo;Here, surely, is the biography that Einstein would have wanted.&rdquo; Much of the book is an exposition of Einstein&rsquo;s work and how he came to his essential ideas.

I put fiction in inverted commas since the novel is entirely based on true events, but as you move through the work, more artistic liberty is taken by the author. It follows the lives and discoveries of some of the greatest mathematical minds of the 20th century.
